# ECG-Representation-Learning
Self-supervised pre-training for symbolic ECG representation with inspiration from NLP

Taking inspiration from recent advancements in NLP, including vector embedding, 
attention and self-supervised pre-training, and taking advantage of large amount of 
ECG data generated, pre-train a model to understand ECG signals.
