# ECG-Representation-Learning
Self-supervised pre-training for symbolic ECG representation with inspiration from NLP

Taking inspiration from recent advancements in NLP, including vector embedding, 
attention and self-supervised pre-training, and taking advantage of large amount of 
ECG data generated, pre-train a model to understand ECG signals. 


## The combined dataset 
TODO: WIP

## To use 
Have the datasets linked above installed. 

Modify the `DIR_DSET` variable in file [`data_path.py`](https://github.com/StefanHeng/ECG-Representation-Learning/blob/master/util/data_path.py) 
as instructed.


A `datasets` folder should be kept at the same level as
this repository, with dataset folder names specified as
in [`config.json`](https://github.com/StefanHeng/ECG-Representation-Learning/blob/master/util/config.json).
